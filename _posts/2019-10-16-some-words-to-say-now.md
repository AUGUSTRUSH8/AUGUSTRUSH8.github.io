Finally, I find the best way that dress me perfectly, I wanna use English to express me layer by layer, to unwrap me, No matter how many grammar faults occurred, Sounds interesting ha?  If kind people like you just sit in front of the screen and reading this article with a cup of tea, I wanna shake hands with you, my friend. (^-^)  Some stories will be told in the following content, which is my own little traits, maybe kind of boring, but all of them are true. if you find something we have in common, I will be very glad to hear some stories from you, sincerely. 

### Right Start From the Beginning

​	First, I talk from the entrance of my college. It comes a long way but I only want to sum it up in a few words. 

​	In the last few months of my junior high school, I work hard, at least I think so, and I ah,, distracted by someone and something, sometimes I daydreaming that I fall in love with her and I get a high score, in other words, I got my dear girlfriend and successfully went to a ideal university. But...I hate this word, but at last, I failed, I went to a university that is very ordinary and I can't say that fucking words to her. ironical experience ha?  

### College Life Stage 1

​	I met some nice people in the entrance day of my college life. I was guided by a senior student from GuiZhou Province, She introduced some interesting activities about my following college life, My spirit was lifted by the shining sun and all those charming things around me. My heart told me: this would be nice trip, make better use of it, don't waste it! 

​	After that, I set up my goal and struggle for it, I get up early, I participate in many associations, I read technical books seriously. you know, it is the state that I want, I immense myself in this fantastic world, full of useful knowledge and nice people and awesome daily activities and .... 

​	In the mean time I take part in a conference which influence me until now, at that conference a senior student talk some personal tricks about how to survive in this competitive college and society, one motto which had supported him struggle for so long is-- "get better a little bit everyday".
